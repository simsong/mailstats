            This function receives an ImapMessage object 'header'
            (consisting only of an email header; the message body will be
            empty), and must return the same 'header' object with
            modifications. The 'header' object that is received has
            a non-standard attribute 'myflags' that is initinalized
            as an empty dict.

            Modifications to the header object have the following
            consequences:

            If you have added a non-standard attribute 'fullprocess' with 
            any value, the full message is downloaded and then passed to
            fullprocess(message). Changes to header fields are discarded.

            If there is no attribute 'fullprocess', the imap flags set
            for the header object are transferred to the server. If the
            \Deleted flag is set, the message is deleted. Otherwise,
            if you have added a non-standard attribute 'mailbox', the
            message is moved to the mailbox set there. The 'mailbox'
            attribute should be a string (indicating a mailbox on the
            current server) or an instance of mailbox.Mailbox. The message
            stays in its current mailbox if there is no
            'mailbox'-attribute.

            You may modify or replace the non-standard attribute
            'myflags', which is intialized as an empty dict, and fill
            it with arbitrary data. The attribute will be present with all
            its data in the full message object that is passed to
            fullprocess(message). The purpose of the 'myflags' attribute
            is to tell fullprocess(message) what to do.

            Note that you may also set the non-standard 'mailbox'
            attribute as described above in combination with the
            'fullprocess' attribute. The 'mailbox' attribute will have no
            direct consequence in this case, but it will be present in
            the message object passed to fullprocess(message). Likewise,
            changes to the imap flags of the 'header' object will also
            be present in the 'message' object.

            In summary, you may modify the 'header' object by changing
            its imapflags, and by adding any of the non-standard
            attributes 'fullprocess', 'mailbox', and 'myflags'. All other
            changes (e.g. to header fields) are discarded. All changes to
            the header fields or the body of the message need to be
            done in fullprocess(message)

            This function receives an ImapMessage object 'message'
            and must return the same 'message' object with modifications.
            The 'message' object will have the non-standard attributes
            'myflags', and 'mailbox', each containing the data set in
            the previously executed preprocess(header). If these
            attributes were not set in preprocess(header), they will
            not be present in 'message' either.

            You may change the 'message' object in any way at all. The
            changed 'message' object that is returned will be added to
            the target mailbox, the original message will be deleted.
